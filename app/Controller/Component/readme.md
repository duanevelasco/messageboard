#[CakePHP image upload files](http://www.githup.com/cakephp2.0_image_upload)

##Overview
The FileUploaderComponent.php and ImageUploaderComponent.php files are components that will help you upload a file (in our case an image) to your server and in the process create thumbnails if necessary
---
 
##How it works

###step 1
Download and place the FileUploaderComponent.php and ImageUploaderComponent.php files in your app/Controller/Component folder

###step 2 
Create in a view your form. In our case we had a file input with the following name="data['file']['image']".

We used the following code :

````php
<?php echo $this->Form->create(null, array('enctype' => 'multipart/form-data','url' => array('controller' => 'upload', 'action' => 'picture')
)); ?>
     <?php echo $this->Form->file('file.image'); ?>
     <input type="submit" value="upload a picture" />
<?php echo $this->Form->end(); ?>
````

to produce the following output :

````html
<form action="/upload/picture" enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" accept-charset="utf-8">
     <div style="display:none;"><input type="hidden" name="_method" value="POST"></div>     
     <input type="file" name="data[file][image]" />     
     <input type="submit" value="upload a picture" />
</form> 
````

###step3
In the ImageUploaderComponent.php the following line includes the FileUploaderComponent.php. Change this line to instantiate the fileuploader component according to your needs.

````php
 /*
  * Loading the component with parameters
  * parameters is an array('extensions'=>array('with','the allowed','extensions'),
  * 'sizeLimit'=> allowed size (in bytes here it is 5 mb = 5 * 1024 * 1024),
  * 'overwrite'=> boolean to allow a file to be overwritten,
  * 'custom_name' => custom name for the uploaded file
  * )
  * 
  */
 public $components = array('FileUploader'=>array('extensions'=>array('jpeg','gif','bmp','jpg','png'),'sizeLimit'=>5242880));
 
````

###step4
In your controller (in our case the controller is  UploadController.php, and the function in which we use the component is 'function picture()') include the ImageUploaderComponent with the following line :

````php
public $components = array('ImageUploader');
````

###step5
In this same controller we call the following function to upload the file
````php
function picture(){
  App::uses('Sanitize', 'Utility');
  
  $output= array();  
  $data=Sanitize::clean($this->request->data);
  
  $file = $data['file']['image'];
  
  //the folder where the files will be stored
  $fileDestination = 'files';
  
  //the folder where the thumbnails will be saved (files/thumbnails/)
  $thumbnailDestination = $fileDestination.'/thumbnails/';
  
  /*
   * 
   * this is an array of options that can be passed to the 
   * ImageUploader function upload($formData, $path=null,$options=array('custom_name'=>null, 'thumbnail'=>null, 'max_width'=>null))
   * 
   * 
   * where $formData is the uploaded file, $path is the path where the file will be saved,
   * and options are available when uploading the image 
   * $options('thumbnail'=>array("max_width"=>'width_for_thumbnail',"max_height"=>'height_for_thumbnail', "path"=>'file/path/for/thumbnail/', "custom_name"=>'custom_name_for_the_thumbnail')
   *          'max_width'=>
   *          'custom_name'=>)
   * Where thumbnail is to create a thumbnail of the image when uploaded, 
   * max_width is to rescale the picture with a specific width,
   * custom_name is a custom name for the uploaded image
   * 
   * If you don't want to use options and simply upload the image just call the upload function without the options' array
   * 
   */   
  $options = array('thumbnail'=>array("max_width"=>180,
                                      "max_height"=>100, 
                                      "path"=>$thumbnailDestination),
                   'max_width'=>700);    
  try{
        //this is where the magic happens we call the function upload using the imageuploader component 
        $output = $this->ImageUploader->upload($file,$fileDestination,$options);
       
   }catch(Exception $e){
          
        $output = array('bool'=>FALSE,'error_message'=>$e->getMessage());
       
      }
      
}
````
